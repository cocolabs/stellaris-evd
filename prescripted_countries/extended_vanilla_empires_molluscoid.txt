The native molluscoids of Naff'Lin, the Tymosh, live in neurosymbiosis with an eel-like creature. Their all-encompassing church promotes the belief that all sentient beings (and the economies that they generate) exist in a similar relationship with an otherworldly spirit known as the Invisible Tentacle. Contacting that spirit, which is most often attempted to win its favor in some material pursuit or another, is achieved through a series of complex rituals and investment decisions. The more financially advantageous those investments are to the Adherence, the greater the spiritual rapture... or so they say."

Even in an era of cheap and instantaneous telecommunications, the individual Phasgol may go years without contacting another sentient being. When such an encounter does come, a Phasgol must be ready. During periods of isolation, they build trinkets, compose poetry, practice jokes, and study the mystic arts of the memeways in the hopes of impressing a caller or visitor. If this fails, they may become frustrated and physically compel a guest to stay. Once trapped, their victims can expect a slow torture by endless rambling hyperbolic conversation and frantic attempts by the Phasgol to demonstrate their cultural savvy and social value.
