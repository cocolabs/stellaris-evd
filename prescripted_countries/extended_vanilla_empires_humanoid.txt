Brutal conflicts with the Chinese and Indian empires over spheres of influence cost many lives, but did little to forestall the Roman Emperors' dominance of their  homeworld. By the industrial age, however, the power of the mercantile elector class within Rome's upper echelons grew to outstrip that of the Senate and even the Emperor himself. These old imperial institutions still exist in the Interstellar Age, but as mere figureheads. Deeply embedded within Terran science, industry, and finance, the Church holds the true reins of power. While the Emperor remains head of state, the highest ecclesiastic leader in Terran society, the Supreme Pontif, is its de facto ruler.

They named it Miranda. There, the colonists quickly put into practice a brave new genetic engineering program to rapidly adapt to the alien planet. In the process, their society bifurcated. A small population of genetically superior lab-grown ('decanted') humans, calling themselves Mirandans, assumed leadership of the colony. Meanwhile, a rapidly reproducing population of genetically labotomized subhuman laborers, called Calibans, were tasked with the hard and dangerous frontier duties of colonial expansion. This experiment enabled the extremely rapid settlement of Miranda and a return to spaceflight within a century of their arrival, but its long-term societal costs can only be guessed at. Mirandans typically distinguish themselves from Calibans by wearing white, grey, or silver clothing."

As a result, they are an ideal labor class, toiling under harsh conditions that would make any of their Mirandan superiors wish for death. Calibans reproduce sexually, unlike their sterile Mirandan kin, and are particularly fertile by normal Human standards, often giving birth to twins. A consequence of their genetic modifications, however, is accelerated telomeric degeneration, resulting in shorter average lifespans."

Learning to extend their awareness outward, beyond the self of body, to embrace the self of group and the self of Humanity, followers found sollace amid endless turmoil.

From Jerusalem to Mecca to Rome, the children of God raise their voices together in hope. The New Dark Ages are ending. With new technology sanctioned by the Guardian Council, mankind will at last attain the stars. The myriad wonders of Creation call out for witness. Each unknown virgin world beckons with the prospect of a new Eden. Rapture is come, and the faithful will ascend to the heavens at last."

The UN Charter amendment of 2061 created the UN Parliamentary Assembly and Protectorate Council, followed in subsequent years by numerous other structural changes. The old Westphalian system was at last fatally undermined by the rise of this world government backed by the military might of emerging superpowers, Brazil and India. Continued administrative integration eventually led to the asymmetric federalization of all UN member states by 2150. In this scheme, off-world colonies are administered by various types of devolved governments under the oversight of the Protectorate until they can qualify for federal incorporation. Reliable FTL travel via hyperlanes and the prospect of interstellar colonization laid the foundation for the UN to evolve yet further into the United Systems Republic, a responsible representative government advancing the interests of Humanity on the galactic stage."
