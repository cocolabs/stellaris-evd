Only a social and technological revolution saved them from extinction. Major governments overlooked their own selfish interests to strike a Grand Accord, agreeing to move a critical portion of their populations to jointly administered orbital habitats while their combined militaries remained planetside to wage a scorched earth campaign against the pandemic. This bold move succeeded, proving T'pheric civilization cannot easily be uprooted."

Approximately 100,000 years ago, the D'chen biomass on its homeworld Ashtar crossed a critical threshold of biological computational bandwidth and manifested a collective consciousness. The more intelligent and articulate D'chen organisms sense this consciousness as a psychic wind, always drifting through their branches and leaves. At times of crisis, this wind becomes a mighty gale, and the D'chen sway and bend with the swirling thoughts of the aggregate mind. Though at times slow to react, once in motion, the Holobiont can mobilize vast material and mental resources to achieve its goals."
