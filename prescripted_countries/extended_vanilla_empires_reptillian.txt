They prefer such order, in fact, to the uncertainties of a more liberated existence. The Askaran Orthodoxy is a theocratic oligarchy that exercises nearly complete control over the physical and spiritual lives of its citizens. Most Askari believe that without such structure and unity, the soul and body are easily lost to misfortune and evil. Chattel slavery is commonplace in their space. On pain of exile (or worse, excommunication), citizens are subject to the fiat of their elders and local priests, and the wider community is subject to constant monitoring by the security apparatuses of the High Ministry. Above them all, the Supreme Orthodox Council creates law and rules on matters of state."

Amid periods of intense warfare in their homeworld's Industrial and Machine Ages, a single constitutional monarchy centered in the southern hemisphere rose to become imperial hegemon of the whole planet. Post-war reforms established a federalized global government with both representative and privy councils under the leadership of the Emperor. To administer global affairs, ensure societal control, and drive economic prosperity, the crown established the Imperial Enterprise. The Enterprise is a massive nationalized corporation to which a sizeable percentage of the Raskenese population is indentured, many by their own choice. Terms of voluntary indenture last between five and fifty years, offer proportionate benefits upon completion, and typically involve less grueling and dangerous labor than 'punitive' or 'reformative' indenture. While outsiders often see only this monolithic face of the Federal Empire, a diversity of cultures and lifestyles continue to thrive in its local jurisdictions."
